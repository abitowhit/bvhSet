## Overview
bvhSet is a simple windows application that allows you to rename your uncompressed bvh files using either the internal bvh file document or cut and paste your own. As long as the files match the bvh XXX-XXX format, they will be renamed to include the description of the animation. An example would be a file called 10_01.bvh will be renamed to 10_01_soccer_-_kick_ball.bvh This is pulled from the CMU bvh rich text document found at http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu along with the bvh files.
